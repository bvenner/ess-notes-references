title:  From Kant to Hegel and Back Again
---

Habermas outlines the development of Hegel's thought, positing a break in his thinking before he published PhG [@hegel:1807:phenomenology].
Habermas develops the notion that "objective spirit" was explicitly inter-subjective, with language and labor playing mediating roles in its development.  However, Hegel's development of the notion of "absolute spirit" marked a return to the Kantian subject, with the absolute spirit playing a very similar role to the transcendental subject.

The risk of historical relativism is the loss of certainty that our socially-mediated values might be incorrect.  The rise of apocalyptic literature and film shows that popular thought is very comfortable with the idea that culture is on the wrong track.  There is a tendency to draw parallels between natural and cultural evolution, in that some cultures are dead ends on the evolutionary tree.  Social darwinism applied to cultural rather than individual units of selection.  This tendency of social thought to interact with natural thought is a major motivation for Gare to revisit natural philosophy, in particular Darwinism.  Gare's analysis of the dominant Western natural philosophy as mechanistic materialism, and that this leads to nihilism in social philosophy.   

Marx clearly borrowed the linear development of absolute spirit in his analysis of capitialism, with the idea that capitalism was a necessary stage on the road to socialism.  

This was the first article by Habermas that I've read all the way through, and I was impressed with its writing and argument.

Interesting comments on this article by Charles Taylor [@taylor:1999:kant].

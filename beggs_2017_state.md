# Exchance and state theories of money

Menger: money has not been generated by law.  In its origin it is a social, and not a state-institution.

Beggs refers to Searle's theory of 'institutional facts,' which generally takes the form of a status function assingment: 'X counts as Y in context C'.  Y are rules, C is the system of rules in which Y is interpreted.  This seems very much like a semiotic analysis, and it brings to mind my previous project on the semiotics of money.  

This was kind of a dissapointing paper.  I was hoping for something that I could forward but this is far from a rebuttal of MMT.

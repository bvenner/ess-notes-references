> For Hegel is the first one to have succeeded, with his concept of "objective sprit," in disclosing and characterizing the uniuqe phenomenon of *the realm between nature and (inner) morality, the realm that could be subsequently be thematized as the appropriate object of the *human sciences* or of *intepretive sociology.* [p. 58]

There is a strong parallel between this move and Murphy's analysis of the "conventional" sign as between the natural and stipulated signs. e.g [@murphy:2002:nature].  (which reminds me that I need to understand Deely's critique of Suarez's instrumentalist approach to semiotics - to what extent does Murphy's reduction of formal semiotics to instrumental semiotics draw from this tradition)

Murphy points out the implications of the collapse of the "conventional" dimension in Scholastic ethical philosophy

> Hegel thus furnishes us with a dialectical introduction to the phenomena encountered in three realms of experience, with together express the lived *ethos* of a human community in the spirit of Aristotle's ethics.

Apel seems to agree with Murphy that the ethical/coventional dimension can be traced to Aristotle.

>Actually, from his day to ours Hegel does have the facts on his side in this
respect - and also in the general sense that the human sense of solidarity
and identity with a community seems most easily maintained when such
a community - whether that of a state, a church, or a political party -
can define and distinguish itself as a *concrete system of self-preservation
asserting itself against another hostile system.*

How do we know that our current consensus on democracy/human rights is on the right path.

First answer:  because of science and the secular culture that has fostered its development.

Second answer:  discourse ethics.

>  It may seem to leave us without any
way of backing our feeling, that we have come to an ethically superior position in
relation to our ancestors of 400 years ago, with reasons. [p 161]

Taylor's way:  

> There is a way of proceeding, by what I have tried to call ‘supersession arguments’,
where we show that there is a rational path from A to B, but not in the
reverse direction. But we have to see this path not only as a line of argument, and
not only as an actual transition, but as both together. [p 161]

> What emerges here is the central role in this kind of argument of the introduction
of new forms of life [p 162]

This reminds me of the generalized evolutionary theory being developed by Kaufmann and others.  This could also link to Smolin's theory of the reality of time.  Some sense of the emergent dynamics of cultural evolution that transcend and include natural evolution must be developed.  

> If we take these intimations seriously, our ethical outlook will be full of
tensions and unresolved conflicts between goods we don’t know yet how to
combine. But that is not the same as saying that the modern moral order is not an
ethical gain.

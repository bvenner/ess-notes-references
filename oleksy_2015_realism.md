# Chapter 1:  Scholastic realism and the coming of the age of individualism  
Olesky does not cite Deely or Poinsot in his book.  So one strategy in reading this book going forward is to re-read Deely's sections on Scotus, Ockham and Poinsot.

Olesky's development of Scotus' notion of common nature (natura communis), which is an intermediate state between the individual and the logical universal.  This is a metaphysical, not an epistemological, notion.

It's interesting how this metaphyics resembles the Commons Transition analysis, where the "common" is between the market and the state.

To what extent is the notion of "common nature" similar to the notion of "type" in type theory?  Or how is it related to Ellerman's notion of "concrete universal?"

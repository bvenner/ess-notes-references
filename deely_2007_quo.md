This article appears to be addressed to Thomists and attempts to resolve confusion about "realism".

Discussion of the role of "species" and distinguishes between "species impressae" and "species expressae".  Says that this term from Latin should be pronounced "spe-chi-es" and should be thought of as "specifier".

Species expressae is similar to "intentionality" in Husserl, but species impressae has no equivalent in phenomenology.

awareness and which distinguishes that awareness in everything whatsoever
it bears upon is the awareness of being - Aquinas, Suma theologiae, Q. 94, art. 2c

Deely identifies *species expressae* as being developed from *species impressae* of external sense by the higher internal senses of memory, imagination and estimation.  Deely also calls them *phantasiari* , cites Poinsot, Tractatus de Signis, Book II, Question 2, 240-253, esp the extended dicussion of this term in note 2, pp. 240-241.

the school that developed out of the writings of Aquinas seems to be that of Poinsot
(Naturalis Philosophiae Prima Pars). [@411], f. 40

> The species expressae of the three higher internal
sense powers — “phantasms” or the species expressae of perception,
of phantasiari, as we may follow the Latins in saying43 — do not of
themselves present their objects as intelligible, not even in what
they contain directly from external sensation of the surrounding
physical environment of existing things. [@413]

So the *species expressae* are potentially intelligible, but have to be made intelligible by the "preconscious acivity of the intellect as agens" [@413].  This process is

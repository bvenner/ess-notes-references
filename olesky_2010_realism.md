# Introduction

Olesky compares Peirce's early "scholastic realism", largely due to Duns Scotus, to his later "pragmatic realism", which significantly modifies his earlier views.  

An interesting project would be to compare Scotus' realism to Poinsot's "semiotic realism".  To what extent did Poinsot's semiotics address the problem of universals.  There might be enough in [@deely:2001:four] to develop this comparison.  I should make an ILL request for Tractatus de Signis.

Olesky also develops some aspects of social philosophy that are assumed by pragmatic realism.  It would be interesting to compare this to Hegel's social philosophy, as developed by Westphal (e.g [@westphal:2016:hegel]), which Westphal calls "natural law constructivism".  (wince Westphal also develops Hegel's epistemology as pragmatic realism.)
